Thanks, Melissa! I'll do some work on the summer idea(s) over the next week or so to see how they fit into a new format for these kind of proposals. If it's OK with you, Ill use the result as an example for the other principals.

This allows for district wide check ins while keeping coverage and instructional time in mind.We discussed how ideally this would be an opportunity for literacy leaders when we have grade level reps across the board.
